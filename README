DISCLAIMER: 
This is a simple script that I wrote for personal usage :) I haven't thoroughly tested the code, so USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

WHAT IS THIS FOR? :D
This script can be used to copy files from your computer to protected directories on an Ubuntu Touch device.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) You have phablet-shell installed.
2) You have connected to the device using phablet-shell at least once.
3) You have write access to the filesystem (if not, connect via phablet-shell
   and run "sudo mount -o remount,rw /"). 
   NOTE: making the root filesystem writable could cause software issues 
   (that can be fixed with a reflash) when updating the device!

USAGE:
./sudoscp_UbuntuTouch <from_path> <dest_path> <device_address> <file> (file)*

Example: ./sudoscp_UbuntuTouch /usr/bin /home/phablet localhost myapp
Note: the path of the files is interpreted as relative to <from_path>.

The example copies /usr/bin/myapp to /home/phablet/myapp on the mobile device.
<device_address> should be either 127.0.0.1 if the device is connected via USB,
or its wlan IP address if you want to connect via Wi-Fi.
